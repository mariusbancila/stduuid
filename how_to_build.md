mkdir build
cd build
```

* Run the following CMake command from the **build** folder to generate projects to target the **x86** platform.
```
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
```

To generate projects to target **x64** use the generator **"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"**.

To generate projects to target **ARM** use the generator **"Visual Studio 15 2017 ARM"**.


## Mac
